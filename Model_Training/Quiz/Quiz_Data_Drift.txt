##===================================

Question 1:
Below are the different causes of data drift that we just discussed. Can you match each of them with the correct example?

Ans:
EXAMPLE										CAUSE OF DATA DRIFT

- A change in customer behavior over time.	- Natural drift in the data
- A sensor breaks and starts providing 		- Data quality issues
  inaccurate readings.
- Two features that used to be correlated 	- Covariate shift
  are no longer correlated.
- A sensor is replaced, causing the units 	- Upstream process changes
  of measurement to change (e.g., from 
  minutes to seconds).
  
Question 2:
Here's the graph of data-drift magnitude that we looked at in the video:
In this example, a baseline January dataset was compared with a dataset containing all 2019 data. Which of these statements about the graph are true?

(Select all that apply.)

Ans:
- The baseline vs. target datasets shows very little difference in January
- The baseline vs. target datasets shows a lot of difference in August
