Question 1:
We can use a table like this to organize our model's output. Suppose that we give the classifier test data containing 10 images, and the results are as follows:
How well has the model performed?

Ans:
- The model performed well, though not perfectly - there were a few misclassified images 

Question 2:
OK, here is a different set of results:
How well has the model performed this time?

Ans:
- The model performed very badly - it misclassified all of the images

Question 3:
Which one of the following is incorrect about confusion matrices?

Ans:
- The sum of FP and TP tells us the number of actual positive cases in the dataset.
