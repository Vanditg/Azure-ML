Question 1:
Below are the examples of dimensionality reduction algorithms that we just described. Can you match each one with its description?

Ans:
DESCRIPTION							ALGORITHM

- A linear dimensionality 			- PCA
  reduction technique based 
  mostly on exact mathematical
  calculations.
- Encodes a larger number of 		- Feature embedding 
  features into a smaller number 
  of "super-features."
- A dimensionality reduction 		- t-SNE
  technique based on a 
  probabilistic approach; useful
  for the visualization of 
  multidimensional data.
