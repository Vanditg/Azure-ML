Question 1:
Which of the following are true statements about Azure Machine Learning datasets?

(Select all that apply.)

Ans:
- Datasets are references that point to the data in your storage service; they are not actually copies, so no extra storage cost is incurred. 
- If you don't have an Azure storage service, you can create a dataset directly from local files, public urls, or an Azure Open Dataset.
