Question 1:
Which of the following are true statements about feature engineering?

(Select all that apply.)

Ans:
- Feature engineering maniplulates existing features in order to create new features, with the goal of improving model training. 
- Feature engineering can be implemented in multiple places, such as at the data source or during model training. 
- Classical machine learning depends on feature engineering much more than deep learning. 

Question 2:
Below are some examples of features you might derive through feature engineering. Can you match the examples with the corresponding type of feature engineering?

Ans:
EXAMPLE								TYPE OF FEATURE ENGINEERING

- Deriving a boolean 				- Flagging 
  (0/1 or True/False) value 
  for each entity
- Getting a count, sum, average,	- Aggregation
  mean, or median from a group of
  entities
- Extracting the month from a date 	- Part-of
  variable
- Grouping customers by age and 	- Binning 
  then calculating average 
  purchases within each group
  
Question 3:
Which of the following are potential benefits of feature engineering?

(Select all that apply.)

Ans:
- Improved model accuracy 
- More appropriate features for some algorithms
