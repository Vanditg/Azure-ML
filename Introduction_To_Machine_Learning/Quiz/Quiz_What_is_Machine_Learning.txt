Ans:
- Machine Learning

Question 3:
Imagine you want to create a function that multiplies two numbers together (e.g., given the inputs 2 and 3, the function will generate the output 6).
What approach is best suited to this problem?

Ans:
- Traditional Programming

Question 4:
Now imagine that you have some images that contain handwritten numbers. You want to create a program that will recognize which number is in each picture, but you're not sure exactly what characteristics can be used to best tell the numbers apart.
Which is the best approach for creating this program?

Ans:
- Machine Learning

Question 5:
In traditional programming, the inputs of hard-coded rules and data are used to arrive at the output of answers, but in machine learning the approach is quite different.
Mark all of the options below that are true statements about machine learning.

Ans:
- Data is input to train an algorithm. 
- Historical answers are input to train an algorithm.
- Rules are the output learned by the algorithm.
