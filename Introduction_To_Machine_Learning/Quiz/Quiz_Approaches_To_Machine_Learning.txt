Question 1:
For each of the descriptions given below, mark which general approach to machine learning it best describes.

Ans:
DESCRIPTION							APPROACH

- Learns how an agent should take	- Reinforcement Learning
  actions in an environment to 
  maximize a reward function
- Learns from data that contains	- Unsupervised Learning 
  only the inputs
- Learns from data that contains 	- Supervised Learning
  both the inputs and expected 
  outputs
- Finds hidden structures in data	- Unsupervised Learning

Question 2:
Now let's get a bit more specific. All of the descriptions below refer to some type of supervised learning. Can you match them up?

Ans:
DESCRIPTION							TYPE OF SUPERVISED LEARNING

- Yields discrete categorical 		- Classification
  outputs
- Learns from data labeled as 		- Anomaly Detection
  normal/abnormal
- Yields continuous numerical 		- Regression
  outputs
- Characteristics of the data are 	- Feature Learning 
  learned using labeled data
- Learns from examples using a 		- Similarity Learning
  similarity function
  
Question 3:
All of the descriptions below refer to some type of unsupervised learning. Can you match them up?

Ans:
DESCRIPTION									TYPE OF UNSUPERVISED LEARNING

- Assigns entities to clusters or groups	- Clustering 
- Learns from unlabeled data assuming 		- Anomaly Detection
  most entities are normal
- Features are learned from unlabeled 		- Feature Learning
  data
 
Question 4:
Harry is an IT admin responsible for managing a legacy Web application. He has access to server performance logs with real-time system performance metrics (CPU, memory utilization, number of user sessions, number of threads, etc.). His task is to use ML to generate automated real-time alerts for preemptively detecting potential service outages.

What type of ML algorithm should Harry use?

Ans:
- Unsupervised
