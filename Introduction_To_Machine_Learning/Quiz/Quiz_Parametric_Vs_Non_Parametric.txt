Question 1:
Which of these sentences are true statements about Machine Learning? (Select all that apply.)

Ans:
- When there is less training data available, simplifying the form of the mapping function to a linear regression model would be the way to go. 
- Non-parametric algorithms do not make assumptions regarding the form of the mapping between input data and output, so they are free to learn any functional form from the training data. 

Question 2:
For the characteristics listed below, see if you can categorize each of them as being more true about parametric or non-parametric algorithms.

Ans:
CHARACTERISTIC								PARAMETRIC OR NON-PARAMETRIC?

- Slower to train, generally having 		- Non-parametric
  far more parameters
- Simpler and easier to understand; 		- Parametric
  easier to interpret the results
- Suitable for problems of limited 			- Parametric
  complexity
- High flexibility; capable of fitting		- Non-parametric
  a large number of functional forms
  
Question 3:
Which of the following algorithms are parametric?

(Select all that apply.)

Ans:
- Logistic Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
