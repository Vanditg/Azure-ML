Question 1:
The goal of machine learning algorithms can be represented as a learning function:

Y = f(X) + eY=f(X)+e

What does each part of this represent?

Ans:
PART			DESCRIPTION

- Y				- Output variable 
- X				- Input variable
- f				- The target function
- e				- Irreducible error

Question 2:
Which of the following statements is most accurate about machine learning?

Ans:
- In practice, it is often best to try a variety of algorithms and compare the results to see which produces the function with the least error.
