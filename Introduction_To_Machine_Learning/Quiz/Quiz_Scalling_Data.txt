Question 1:
Which of the below refers to standardization and which refers to normalization?

Ans:
DESCRIPTION 								STANDARDIZATION OR NORMALIZATION?

- Rescales the data to have mean = 0 		- Standardization
  and standard deviation = 1

- Rescales the data into the range [0, 1]	- Normalization

- (𝑥 −𝑥𝑚𝑖𝑛)/(𝑥𝑚𝑎𝑥 −𝑥𝑚𝑖𝑛)						- Normalization

- (𝑥 − 𝜇)/𝜎									- Standardization

Question 2:
Standardize -5,10,15. Knowing that the mean is 7 and the standard deviation is 10. Use commas to separate numbers and keep one decimal place (e.g. 1.0,2.3,3.0 or -1.5,1.1,2.4)

Ans:
- -1.2, 0.3, 0.8 

Question 3:
Normalize -5,10,15. Knowing that the mean is 7 and the standard deviation is 10. Use commas to separate numbers and keep one decimal place (e.g. 1.0,2.3,3.0 or -1.5,1.1,2.4)

Ans:
- 0.0, 0.8, 1.0
