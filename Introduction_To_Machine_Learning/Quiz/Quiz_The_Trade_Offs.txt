Question 1:
Here are the main terms we just discussed. See if you can match each of them with its description.

Ans:
DESCRIPTION										TERM

- Error that occurs when the model is too		- Variance
  sensitive to the training data (thus giving 	
  different estimates when given new training 
  data)
- Modeling the training data well, but not 		- Overfitting 
  generalizing well to new data
- failing to model the training data and 		- Underfitting 
  failing to generalize to new data
- Error that results from inaccurate 			- Bias
  assumptions in model training (that 
  are made to simplify the training process)
  
Question 2:
In machine learning, we often refer to a model as being overfitted when...

Ans:
- It is learning the training data too well at the expense of not generalizing well to new data. 

Question 3:
Which one of the statements is true about bias and variance.

Ans:
- Increased model complexity generally increases variance. 

Question 4:
Which technique can be used to reduce overfitting?

(Select all that apply.)

Ans:
- Have a validation dataset
- Use k-fold cross-validation
- Use PCA
