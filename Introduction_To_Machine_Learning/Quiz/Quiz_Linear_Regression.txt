Question 1:
For the earlier example of students studying for a test, suppose that we find that the line of best fit is:

y = 15 x + 3y=15x+3

Where xx is the number of hours studied and yy is the number of questions correctly answered.

If a student studied 10 hours for the test, what is their predicted score?

Ans:
- 153

Question 2:
Thinking back to the models vs. algorithms distinction, is our equation…

y = 15 x + 3y=15x+3

…best described as a model or an algorithm?

Ans:
- y = 15x + 3 is a model
