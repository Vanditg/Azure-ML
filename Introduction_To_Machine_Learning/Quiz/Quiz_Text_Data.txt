Question 1:
Here's another example:

Original text					Normalized text
Mary had a little lamb.			[Mary, have, a, little, lamb]

Ans:
- It means that the word rabid has some importance in rabid, hare. 

Question 3:
What vector will be used to represent 'Quick, lazy hare'.

Ans:
- [0.32, 0.0, 0.12, 0.0, 0.0, 0.12]

Question 4:
Imagine the words "monkey", "rabbit", "bird" and "raven" are represented by vectors with the same length. Based on the meanings of the words, which two words would we expect to have the smallest vector distance?

Ans:
- 'Raven' and 'Bird'

Question 5:
What is the typical pipeline for a classification model using text data?

Ans:
- Normalize text > Vectorize text > Train model > Deploy model
