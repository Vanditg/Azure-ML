Question 1:
Which of the following statements about linear regression are incorrect?

(Select all that apply.)

Ans:
- A general equation like y = mx + b is a model. 
- Simple linear regression uses a plane to describe relationship between variables 

Question 2:
One of the things that can be difficult when looking at a machine learning algorithm is that different terms and symbols are often used to refer to the same (or very closely related) things.

With that in mind, can you match the following terms?

Ans:

Linear Regression				Machine Learning
- Slope							- Coefficient 
- Intercept 					- Bias 
- RMSE							- Cost Function 

Question 3:
Which of the following about training a linear regression model is correct?

(Select all that apply.)

Ans:
- The training process is a process of minimizing the error. 
- A cost function is used to calculate the error of a model. 
- It is always a good idea to rescale data. 

Question 4:
Which one of the following is not necessary when preparing data for a linear regression model?

Ans:
- Make sure the error is minimized.
