##===================================

Question 1:
Here are the typical steps of the data science process that we just discussed. Can you remember the correct order?

Ans:
	Step 				Description
- Steps 1 & 2			- Collect and prepare the data

- Steps 3 & 4			- Train the model and evaluate its performance

- Steps 5 & 6 			- Deploy the model and then retrain as necessary

Question 2:
Here are some of the steps once again, along with some of the actions that you would carry out during those steps. Can you match the step with the appropriate action?
(Again, first try to do it from memoryâ€”but have a look at the text or video above if you get stuck.)

Ans:

  the model
 
- Select the algorithm, and 		- Train the model
  prepare training, testing, 
  and validation data sets
  
Question 3:
In machine learning, often you have to tune parameters for the chosen learning algorithm to improve the performance on relevant metrics, such as prediction accuracy. At what stage of the data science lifecycle do you optimize the parameters?

Ans:
- Training the model
