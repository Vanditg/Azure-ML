Question 1:
Can you match each of these types of regression with the appropriate characteristics?

Ans:
CHARACTERISTICS						REGRESSION TYPE

- Accurate, fast training times		- Decision Forest Regression
- Accurate, long training times		- Neural Net Regression
- Fast training, linear model		- Linear Regression

Question 2:
Match the following hyperparameters with their respective descriptions.

Ans:
DESCRIPTION										HYPERPARAMETER

- A value that defines the step taken at 		- Number of learning iterations
  each iteration, before correction.
- Penalize models to prevent overfitting.		- Learning rate 
- The maximum number of times the algorithm 	- Gradient descent 
  processes the training cases.
- A method that minimizes the amount of error	- L2 regularization weight 
  at each step of the model training process.
