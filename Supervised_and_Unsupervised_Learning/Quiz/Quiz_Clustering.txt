Question 1:
Here are the main types of clustering algorithms we just discussed. Can you match each one with its description?

Ans:
DESCRIPTION								TYPE OF CLUSTERING

- Groups members based on how closely	- Density-based clustering
  they are packed together; can learn 
  clusters of arbitrary shape.
- Builds a tree of clusters.			- Hierarchical clustering
- Groups members based on their 		- Centroid-based clustering
  distance from the center of the 
  cluster.
- Groups members based on the 			- Distribution-based clustering
  probability of a member belonging
  to a particular distribution.
  
Question 2:
Which of the following statements are true about the K-means clustering algorithm?

(Select all that apply.)

Ans:
- K-means is a centroid-based, unsupervised clustering algorithm. 
- It creates up to a target (K) number of clusters and groups similar members together in a cluster.
