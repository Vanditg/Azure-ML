Question 1:
As we just discussed, at a high level there are three main categories of classification algorithms. Can you match each of them with the correct description?

Ans:
DESCRIPTION									TYPE OF CLASSIFICATION

- The classifier chooses from multiple		- Multi-class multi-label classification
  categories; each output can belong to 
  one or more categories.
- The classifier chooses from multiple 		- Multi-class single-label classification
  categories; each output belongs to 
  single category only.
- The classifier choose from only two 		- Binary classification
  categories; each output belongs to 
  one or the other.
  
Question 2:
Given the following confusion matrix:

Class		Positive	Negative
Positive	50			5
Negative	20			100

What is the value for the Precision metric?

Ans:
- 0.91
